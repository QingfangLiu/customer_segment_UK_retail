# ðŸ§ª ML/DL Toy Projects

This repository contains a collection of small-scale, self-contained data science projects. Each project explores a specific method, dataset, or idea, often implemented from scratch or in a simplified setting.

These projects reflect personal experimentation, learning, and curiosity.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out if you find something interesting!
